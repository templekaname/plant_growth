# plant_growth
This repo contains three sets of growth analyses.
All the code is in a jupyter notebook format.

1. `mcmahon1973.ipynb` --- recreated analysis scheme of the article *Elastic Beams of Greatest Lateral Extent* (1973) by Thomas A. McMahon.

2. `yamam.ipynb` --- recreated analysis scheme of the article *Growth Stress Controls Negative Gravitropism in Woody Plant Stems* (2002) by H. Yamamoto.

3. directory `GrowthAnalysis` --- original analysis scheme with evolving intrinsic curvature. There are three codes:
`main.ipynb` is the main analysis scheme (which includes the explanation of the equations as markdown).
`eps_compare` and `taper_compare` contain very similar code, but made for comparing the different epsilon values and taper functions in the code and superposing
graphs of different parameters.
The directory also includes some sample videos generated by the corresponding code.
